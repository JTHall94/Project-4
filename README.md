# Project-4

The purpose of the project is to create a laravel-based art gallery website that allows users to view the entire gallery of posts, while also allowing them to add, edit, and delete posts of their own.
The theme is Nature photography!

In order to contribute to the project, you must follow 4 basic steps:

1. On the command line, run "composer install". 

2. Then, run "npm install".

3. Next, copy the env example file's contents into your local env file. Run "cp .env.example .env"

4. Generate a new, unique app key that will allow you to contribute to the project. Run "php artisan key:generate" and make sure that it is present in your env file.

After that, you should be able to work on the project!
